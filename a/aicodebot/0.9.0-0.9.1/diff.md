 ‚ö†Ô∏è AICodeBot currently uses OpenAI's ChatGPT large language models, which can hallucinate and be confidently wrong. Sometimes AICodeBot does dumb things, which is why it's mostly *reading* and *advising* and not yet *writing*. Much like Tesla's "Full Self Driving", you have to keep your hands on the wheel.
 
 It's also not a "build a site for me in 5 minutes" tool that takes a well constructed prompt and builds a scaffold for you. There are [other tools](https://github.com/AntonOsika/gpt-engineer) for that. It's not a no-code platform. Instead, AICodeBot is built to work with existing code bases and the git-commit level. It's designed to multiply the effectiveness of capable engineers.

 ### AI Sidekick ü¶∏‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
 
  `aicodebot sidekick` Your AI-powered coding assistant. It's designed to help you with your coding tasks by providing context-aware suggestions and solutions. Think ChatGPT with the ability to read local files for context.
 
  By default it will pass along a directory of files from the current working directory, and you can also pass in a list of files to use as context. For example:
 
  ```bash
  aicodebot sidekick file1.py file2.py
  ```
 
-In this example, the sidekick will read in the contents of file1.py and file2.py and use them to provide context-aware answers. For example:
-
-* How can I make this code better?
-* Tell me how to add a new feature to this code.
-* Fix an issue that I'm having... (paste the error, stack trace, etc.)
-* Write unit tests for the xyz function.
+In this example, the sidekick will read in the contents of file1.py and file2.py and use them to provide context-aware answers.
 
 Pro-tip: add your README.md to the list of files to get context-aware answers.
 
 This feature is in it's early phases right now, but it's already useful. We'll be adding support for tools that the sidekick can use, including GitHub integration, ingesting repository specific domain knowledge, writing local files, and more. For now, it just *reads* files and provides suggestions.

 ### Open AI key setup
 
 The first time you run it, you'll be prompted to enter your OpenAI API Key, which is required, as we use OpenAI's large language models for the AI. You can get one for free by visiting your [API key settings page](https://platform.openai.com/account/api-keys").
 
-#### Which Language Model? GPT-3.5 vs GPT-4
+Note: You will be billed by OpenAI based on how much you use it. Typical developers will use less than $10/month - which if you are a professional developer you'll likely more than make up for with saved time and higher quality work. See [OpenAI's pricing page](https://openai.com/pricing/) for more details.
 
-When using AICodeBot, you have the option to use either GPT-3.5 or GPT-4. While GPT-4 can often provide more accurate and detailed responses, GPT-3.5 is faster and might be sufficient for simpler tasks. We highly recommend GPT-4.
+#### Which Language Model? GPT-3.5 vs GPT-4
 
 Not all OpenAI accounts have GPT-4 API access enabled. By default, AICodeBot will use GPT-4 if your OpenAI account supports it, we will check the first time you run it. Tip: If your OpenAI API does not support GPT-4, you can ask to be added to the waitlist [here](https://openai.com/waitlist/gpt-4-api)
 
 Note: We'll be adding more options for AI models in the future, including those that can be run locally, such as [GPT4all](https://gpt4all.io/) and HuggingFace's [Transformers](https://huggingface.co/transformers/).

 ‚ö†Ô∏è AICodeBot currently uses OpenAI's ChatGPT large language models, which can hallucinate and be confidently wrong. Sometimes AICodeBot does dumb things, which is why it's mostly *reading* and *advising* and not yet *writing*. Much like Tesla's "Full Self Driving", you have to keep your hands on the wheel.
 
 It's also not a "build a site for me in 5 minutes" tool that takes a well constructed prompt and builds a scaffold for you. There are [other tools](https://github.com/AntonOsika/gpt-engineer) for that. It's not a no-code platform. Instead, AICodeBot is built to work with existing code bases and the git-commit level. It's designed to multiply the effectiveness of capable engineers.

 ### AI Sidekick ü¶∏‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
 
  `aicodebot sidekick` Your AI-powered coding assistant. It's designed to help you with your coding tasks by providing context-aware suggestions and solutions. Think ChatGPT with the ability to read local files for context.
 
  By default it will pass along a directory of files from the current working directory, and you can also pass in a list of files to use as context. For example:
 
  ```bash
  aicodebot sidekick file1.py file2.py
  ```
 
-In this example, the sidekick will read in the contents of file1.py and file2.py and use them to provide context-aware answers. For example:
-
-* How can I make this code better?
-* Tell me how to add a new feature to this code.
-* Fix an issue that I'm having... (paste the error, stack trace, etc.)
-* Write unit tests for the xyz function.
+In this example, the sidekick will read in the contents of file1.py and file2.py and use them to provide context-aware answers.
 
 Pro-tip: add your README.md to the list of files to get context-aware answers.
 
 This feature is in it's early phases right now, but it's already useful. We'll be adding support for tools that the sidekick can use, including GitHub integration, ingesting repository specific domain knowledge, writing local files, and more. For now, it just *reads* files and provides suggestions.

 ### Open AI key setup
 
 The first time you run it, you'll be prompted to enter your OpenAI API Key, which is required, as we use OpenAI's large language models for the AI. You can get one for free by visiting your [API key settings page](https://platform.openai.com/account/api-keys").
 
-#### Which Language Model? GPT-3.5 vs GPT-4
+Note: You will be billed by OpenAI based on how much you use it. Typical developers will use less than $10/month - which if you are a professional developer you'll likely more than make up for with saved time and higher quality work. See [OpenAI's pricing page](https://openai.com/pricing/) for more details.
 
-When using AICodeBot, you have the option to use either GPT-3.5 or GPT-4. While GPT-4 can often provide more accurate and detailed responses, GPT-3.5 is faster and might be sufficient for simpler tasks. We highly recommend GPT-4.
+#### Which Language Model? GPT-3.5 vs GPT-4
 
 Not all OpenAI accounts have GPT-4 API access enabled. By default, AICodeBot will use GPT-4 if your OpenAI account supports it, we will check the first time you run it. Tip: If your OpenAI API does not support GPT-4, you can ask to be added to the waitlist [here](https://openai.com/waitlist/gpt-4-api)
 
 Note: We'll be adding more options for AI models in the future, including those that can be run locally, such as [GPT4all](https://gpt4all.io/) and HuggingFace's [Transformers](https://huggingface.co/transformers/).
