-<strong>A python package for creating subscription Streamlit apps </strong>
+<strong>A python package for creating paid Streamlit apps with a paywall! </strong>
 
 ## Overview
 
-This package gives you two basic functions (`require_auth` and `add_auth`) that add subscription functionality to your Streamlit apps. `require_auth` will add both a Google login button and a Stripe subscription button to your sidebar, and will stop your entire app with `st.stop()` if the user is not logged in and subscribed. If they are subscribed, `st.session_state.user_subscribed` will be true, and if they are logged in, `st.session_state.email` will have their email. If the user is not logged in or subscribed, they will be prompted to do so in the sidebar.
-`add_auth` does the same, except it does not stop the app but instead just surfaces the `st.session_state` information detailed above, which means the developer can control exactly what they would like to show to the subscribed vs unsubscribed user!

 This package expects that you have a `.streamlit/secrets.toml` file which you will have to create. Inside it, you will need to add your Stripe and Google API information that runs the authentication and subscription parts of the package.
 
 ### Stripe
 
 In order to set up your Stripe (the best and easiest payment infrastructure in the world), go to [Stripe.com](https://stripe.com) and make an account. Once you make an account, you need to make a [payment subscription link](https://dashboard.stripe.com/test/payment-links/create) (which is in test mode by default) and add the link to your app (currently held in streamlit_app.py). If the user to your app logs in and has not already signed up and paid via Stripe, they will be asked to subscribe before they can see the rest of the app.
